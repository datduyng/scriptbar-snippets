This is very handy for quickly testing ideas in the console and rapidly injecting code into existing sites. Console Injector searches cdnjs for javascript libraries matching a given input string, prompt you to validate your choice and inserts the latest corresponding script hosted at cdnjs.cloudflare.com.

#### Example
- `console.inject('query')`
- `console.inject('three')`
